Updates Cloudflare with current IP

So I got sick of all those free dynamic dns services and fortunately some nice person on Reddit came up with this idea:
https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/9nimtz/use_cloudflare_as_dynamic_dns_with_raspberry_pi/
If you are a Redditor please go give u/TheFirsh some tasty tasty karma.

 Cloudflare will host your DNS for free, on top of a whole heap of other benefits, and they have a really good API for updating DNS records. The idea is that you run this script like you would a dynamic DNS client - it's python so entirely cross platform and uses minimal and very common libraries.
 
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Refried-Bean/pyflare/wiki) for how to use it.
